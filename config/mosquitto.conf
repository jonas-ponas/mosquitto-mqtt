## Authentication ##
# By default, Mosquitto >=2.0 allows only authenticated connections. Change to true to enable anonymous connections.
allow_anonymous false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Certificate based SSL/TLS support

# Path to the PEM encoded server certificate.
certfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.crt

# Path to the PEM encoded keyfile.
keyfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.key

# By setting require_certificate to true, the client must provide a
# valid certificate in order for the network connection to
# proceed. This allows access to the broker to be controlled outside
# of the mechanisms provided by MQTT.
require_certificate true

# cafile and capath define methods of accessing the PEM encoded
# Certificate Authority certificates that will be considered trusted when
# checking incoming client certificates.

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained
# messages.
persistence false

# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
# false then a password file should be created (see the
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
#
# Defaults to false, unless there are no listeners defined in the configuration
# file, in which case it is set to true, but connections are only allowed from
# the local machine.
allow_anonymous false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options. If an auth_plugin is used as well as
# password_file, the auth_plugin check will be made first.
